				<p>My name is Stephen Ruiz, and Iâ€™m a newish designer with an interest in user interaction on web and mobile. I like to make things people use, learn how and why they work, then make them better. I made this site to show you <bb>Cycle Map</bb>, a mobile application prototype I built in <a href="https://framer.com/" alt="Framer Studio">Framer Studio</a>, using CoffeeScript for controls and animations and Sketch for icons and art-working. The full prototype can be explored <a href="https://framer.cloud/cnuRj" alt="Cycle Map Framer Prototype">here.</a></p>
				<p>Cycle Map is an early attempt at building a full prototype from scratch. It's an education project, designed and built in several iterations, that I hope it shows off what both Framer Studio and I can do together. If you like the project or are interested in working together, <a href="#contact" alt="Contact">please let me know</a>.</p>
				<p><b>The Demo</b></p>
				<p>On the following pages, I've put together quick <a href="/cyclemap.html" alt="Cycle Map Demo">step by step</a> tour of the features I built in the prototype.</p>
				<p> I've also included <a href="/cyclemapdesign.php" alt="Design">documentation of my design process</a>, including initial sketches and wireframes, early versions of the app, and some writing on the usability challenges I encountered, the concepts I brought to the prototype, and the decisions I made while I designed it.</p>
				<p><b>Background</b></p>
				<p>I was inspired to design Cycle Map by <a href="http://cycle.travel/map" alt="Cycle.Travel">cycle.travel</a>, an excellent journey planner for cyclists, edited by Richard Fairhurst with site design by <a href="http://www.simonclayson.co.uk/" alt="Simon Clayson Design">Simon Clayson Design</a>. I am not affiliated with either organization, except as a user of the cycle.travel site. As cycle.travel does not yet have a mobile application, I took a shot at designing one myself, interested in the challenges presented by such an application and, as a cyclist myself, already familiar with some of the user needs.</p>
				<p><b>This Website</b></p>
				<p>To show the project off, I also prototyped, designed and built this website using jQuery, Bootstrap, and a little PHP. (If you're reading this sentence then I'm still developing the website and would appreciate feedback and forgiveness for any incomplete features.)</p>
				<p><b>And Finally...</b></p>
				<p> I'm looking for a career in the field of user interface/interaction design, so please <a href="#contact" alt="Contact">let me know</a> if you're interested in this project or want to discuss any opportunities to do this kind of thing during daylight hours.</p>
