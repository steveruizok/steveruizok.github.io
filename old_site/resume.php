<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>My name is Stephen Ruiz, and I’m a newish designer with an interest in user interaction on web and mobile. I like to make things people use, learn how and why they work, then make them better.</p>
<p>I have a background in contemporary art, both as an <a href="http://steveruizart.com">artist</a> and a <a href="http://chicagoartreview.com/" alt="Chicago Art Review">writer</a>. In 2013, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Master’s Degree in Fine Art. After several years working as an artist, journalist and editor of the art events calendar The Visualist, I moved to the United Kingdom and began transitioning into user interface design, studying the theory and building new skills in software and analysis.</p>
<p>I’m currently working as a typesetter for Canon UK.</p>
